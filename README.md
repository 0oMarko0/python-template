# Python Template
A modern Python project template with batteries included.

- **[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)** – Fast dependency manager and build system  
- **[ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/)** – Linting and formatting in one tool  
- **[pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/)** – Testing framework  
- **[pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)** – Git hooks for automatic code quality checks  
- **[commitizen](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/)** – Conventional commits and automated changelogs  

## Requirements
- Python **3.13** or later  
- [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/installation/)

Install `uv` with:

```bash
curl -Ls https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | bash
```

Or follow the [official installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for your platform.

## Setup
1. Create a virtual environment and install development dependencies:

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv sync --group dev
```

2. Install the pre-commit hooks:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

3. Run checks to verify your environment is properly set up:

```bash
ruff check .
pre-commit run --all-files
pytest
```

### Conventional Commits
The changelog is autogenerated based on commit messages.  
To enable this, all commits must follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format.

### Releasing
To release a new version:

1. Set up your project on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) and link it to your GitHub repository.
2. Use the `release` GitHub Action to trigger a version bump and publish the package.
